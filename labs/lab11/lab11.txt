The French baguette is very popular. The baguette is a long type of bread. France makes around 16 million baguettes every day.

Recently, French bakeries close. Every year, more than 400 of them close. The French government wants to do something about the situation.

For a long time, the country wants the baguette to be on a global list. The global list is for UNESCO and cultural heritage. The list explains things that must last for the next generations.

Last week, UNESCO experts put the French baguette on the list. The French government will make a baguette day. This day will make the French people proud of the product.
